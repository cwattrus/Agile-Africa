						<p>I am an author, speaker... essentially a loud-mouthed pundit on the topic of software development. I've been working in the software industry since the mid-80's where I got into the then-new world of object-oriented software. I spent much of the 90's as a consultant and trainer helping people develop object-oriented systems, with a focus on enterprise applications. In 2000 I joined ThoughtWorks.</p>
						<p>My main interest is to understand how to design software systems, so as to maximize the productivity of development teams. In doing this I've looked to understand the patterns of good software design, and also the processes that support software design. I've become a big fan of agile approaches and the resulting focus on evolutionary software design.</p>

						I'm passionate about agile methodologies as the basis for creating positive working environments for complex adaptive work, creating the space for team members of all levels to apply, share and extend their knowledge in a commercially responsible context.
						
						<p>I place particular value on facilitation as a tool for harnessing the knowledge of teams and individuals to direct meaningful and situationally-relevant change, which ultimately enables team members to work towards autonomy, mastery and purpose - the cornerstones of intrinsic motivation.<p>
						I'm committed to sharing agile knowledge and am an active participant and mentor in the Cape Town coaching circles as well as committee member of the Scrum User Group South Africa.
						<p>The software industry has been my home for 10 years, with a prior background in fine art and collaborative creative projects, which feed directly into my experience of software development.</p>

						I started my career as a developer. Attention to detail, finding and fixing bugs, and also communicating well to managers and customers quickly saw me promoted to Team Lead and then to Development manager. It was in this position, on a death march project, that I realized there had to be another way and recalled a pleasant project I worked on as a developer – a scrum project. After much reading, and applying some changes, I realized that I wanted to be a scrum master and started my new agile career. 
						<p>Now, a few years later I find myself guiding and mentoring others with a passion for agile. I strongly believe that everyone should enjoy and love what they do, which is why my day job at Growing Agile is all about my passion of growing agile people. I strive to make the entire process from business vision to development less frustrating and more rewarding for everyone involved. I have spoken at some large Agile conferences and met some amazing people worldwide. </p>
						My personal motto is 'be brave', and I embody this by taking on challenges one small step at a time. On weekends you can find me trail running on a mountain or being lazy on the couch with my family.</p>
